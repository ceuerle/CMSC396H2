TURING WAS BORN IN PADDINGTON, LONDON, WHILE HIS FATHER WAS ON LEAVE FROM HIS POSITION WITH THE INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE (ICS) AT CHHATRAPUR, BIHAR AND ORISSA PROVINCE, IN BRITISH INDIA.[14][15] TURING'S FATHER, JULIUS MATHISON TURING (1873.1947), WAS THE SON OF A CLERGYMAN FROM A SCOTTISH FAMILY OF MERCHANTS WHICH HAD BEEN BASED IN THE NETHERLANDS AND INCLUDED A BARONET. JULIUS'S WIFE, ALAN'S MOTHER, WAS ETHEL SARA (NÈE STONEY; 1881.1976), DAUGHTER OF EDWARD WALLER STONEY, CHIEF ENGINEER OF THE MADRAS RAILWAYS. THE STONEYS WERE A PROTESTANT ANGLO-IRISH GENTRY FAMILY FROM BOTH COUNTY TIPPERARY AND COUNTY LONGFORD, WHILE ETHEL HERSELF HAD SPENT MUCH OF HER CHILDHOOD IN COUNTY CLARE.[16] JULIUS' WORK WITH THE ICS BROUGHT THE FAMILY TO BRITISH INDIA, WHERE HIS GRANDFATHER HAD BEEN A GENERAL IN THE BENGAL ARMY. HOWEVER, BOTH JULIUS AND ETHEL WANTED THEIR CHILDREN TO BE BROUGHT UP IN ENGLAND, SO THEY MOVED TO MAIDA VALE,[17] LONDON, WHERE TURING WAS BORN ON 23 JUNE 1912, AS RECORDED BY A BLUE PLAQUE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE OF HIS BIRTH,[18][19] LATER THE COLONNADE HOTEL.[14][20] HE HAD AN ELDER BROTHER, JOHN (THE FATHER OF SIR JOHN DERMOT TURING, 12TH BARONET OF THE TURING BARONETS).

HIS FATHER'S CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION WAS STILL ACTIVE, AND DURING TURING'S CHILDHOOD YEARS HIS PARENTS TRAVELLED BETWEEN HASTINGS IN ENGLAND[21] AND INDIA, LEAVING THEIR TWO SONS TO STAY WITH A RETIRED ARMY COUPLE. AT HASTINGS, TURING STAYED AT BASTON LODGE, UPPER MAZE HILL, ST LEONARDS-ON-SEA, NOW MARKED WITH A BLUE PLAQUE.[22]

VERY EARLY IN LIFE, TURING SHOWED SIGNS OF THE GENIUS HE WAS LATER TO DISPLAY PROMINENTLY.[23] HIS PARENTS PURCHASED A HOUSE IN GUILDFORD IN 1927, AND TURING LIVED THERE DURING SCHOOL HOLIDAYS. THE LOCATION IS ALSO MARKED WITH A BLUE PLAQUE.[24]

HIS PARENTS ENROLLED HIM AT ST MICHAEL'S, A DAY SCHOOL AT 20 CHARLES ROAD, ST LEONARDS-ON-SEA, AT THE AGE OF SIX. THE HEADMISTRESS RECOGNISED HIS TALENT EARLY ON, AS DID MANY OF HIS SUBSEQUENT EDUCATORS. IN 1926, AT THE AGE OF 13, HE WENT ON TO SHERBORNE SCHOOL, A WELL KNOWN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL IN THE MARKET TOWN OF SHERBORNE IN DORSET. THE FIRST DAY OF TERM COINCIDED WITH THE 1926 GENERAL STRIKE IN BRITAIN, BUT SO DETERMINED WAS HE TO ATTEND THAT HE RODE HIS BICYCLE UNACCOMPANIED MORE THAN 60 MILES (97 KM) FROM SOUTHAMPTON TO SHERBORNE, STOPPING OVERNIGHT AT AN INN.[25]
KING'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, WHERE THE COMPUTER ROOM IS NAMED AFTER TURING, WHO BECAME A STUDENT THERE IN 1931 AND A FELLOW IN 1935

TURING'S NATURAL INCLINATION TOWARD MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE DID NOT EARN HIM RESPECT FROM SOME OF THE TEACHERS AT SHERBORNE, WHOSE DEFINITION OF EDUCATION PLACED MORE EMPHASIS ON THE CLASSICS. HIS HEADMASTER WROTE TO HIS PARENTS: "I HOPE HE WILL NOT FALL BETWEEN TWO STOOLS. IF HE IS TO STAY AT PUBLIC SCHOOL, HE MUST AIM AT BECOMING EDUCATED. IF HE IS TO BE SOLELY A SCIENTIFIC SPECIALIST, HE IS WASTING HIS TIME AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL".[26] DESPITE THIS, TURING CONTINUED TO SHOW REMARKABLE ABILITY IN THE STUDIES HE LOVED, SOLVING ADVANCED PROBLEMS IN 1927 WITHOUT HAVING STUDIED EVEN ELEMENTARY CALCULUS. IN 1928, AGED 16, TURING ENCOUNTERED ALBERT EINSTEIN'S WORK; NOT ONLY DID HE GRASP IT, BUT HE EXTRAPOLATED EINSTEIN'S QUESTIONING OF NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION FROM A TEXT IN WHICH THIS WAS NEVER MADE EXPLICIT.[27]

AT SHERBORNE, TURING FORMED AN IMPORTANT FRIENDSHIP WITH FELLOW PUPIL CHRISTOPHER MORCOM, WHICH PROVIDED INSPIRATION IN TURING'S FUTURE ENDEAVOURS. HOWEVER, THE FRIENDSHIP WAS CUT SHORT BY MORCOM'S DEATH IN FEBRUARY 1930 FROM COMPLICATIONS OF BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS CONTRACTED AFTER DRINKING INFECTED COW'S MILK SOME YEARS PREVIOUSLY.[28][29] THIS EVENT SHATTERED TURING'S RELIGIOUS FAITH. HE BECAME AN ATHEIST. HE BELIEVED THAT ALL PHENOMENA, INCLUDING THE WORKINGS OF THE HUMAN BRAIN, MUST BE MATERIALISTIC,[30] WHILE MAINTAINING A BELIEF THAT THE SPIRIT SURVIVES AFTER DEATH.[31]
